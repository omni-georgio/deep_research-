# Welcome to Deep Research

This is a research tool as a multi-agent AI research system designed to know what it knows (and doesn't know) when conducting research.

This might seem like a small thing within research, but if you really think about it, this is the start of something much bigger. If the agents can understand what they don't know—just like a human—they can reason about what they need to learn. This has the potential to make the process of agents acquiring information much, much faster and in turn being much smarter.

## The Vision

Currently, AI research agents have significant limitations - they often make assumptions, fabricate information, or miss crucial context. This project was heavily inspired by two groundbreaking works:

1. ["TICKing All the Boxes: Generated Checklists Improve LLM Evaluation and Generation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03608) by Jonathan Cook, it demonstrated how structured checklists can significantly improve LLM evaluation and generation quality.

2. [NVIDIA's Nemotron-4 340B Reward Model](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemotron-4-340b-reward), which pioneered techniques for reward modeling in the loop. Their work on reward-based learning has influenced our approach to quality assessment and continuous improvement in research tasks.

## System Architecture

This project is built on [CAMEL-AI's Workforce system](https://docs.camel-ai.org/key_modules/workforce.html), which provides a robust framework for coordinating multiple AI agents. The workforce architecture enables our agents to work together seamlessly, with built-in task management and failure handling.

## How It Works

The system operates through 5 key components:

### 1. Recipes
Think of these as detailed instructions for the research process. While currently manual, future versions will aim to automate recipe generation. Recipes specify:
- Required information ("ingredients")
- Output format
- Example outputs
- Research parameters

### 2. Research Intelligence Planning Agent
The first step in our research pipeline:
- Analyzes input content against recipe requirements
- Maps known vs unknown information
- Creates structured research plans
- Identifies which gaps can be filled through research

### 3. Deep Search Agent
Our dedicated researcher:
- Executes research plans
- Uses Google search strategically
- Verifies information from multiple sources
- Documents findings and confidence levels

### 4. Report Creator Agent
Our content synthesizer:
- Combines original content with research findings
- Follows recipe format requirements
- Maintains clear sourcing
- Highlights any remaining uncertainties

### 5. The Judge Agent
Our final quality check:
- Evaluates output completeness
- Checks adherence to recipe
- Validates information accuracy
- Provides detailed quality metrics

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- API Keys:
  - OpenAI API key (for GPT-4)
  - Anthropic API key (for Claude)
  - Google Custom Search API key
  - Google Custom Search Engine ID (cx)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/deep-research.git
cd deep-research
```

2. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API keys:
```bash
# Required API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...  # Your OpenAI API key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...  # Your Anthropic API key

# Google Search Configuration
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIza...  # Your Google API key
GOOGLE_CX_ID=...  # Your Custom Search Engine ID

# Optional Configuration
MODEL_NAME=gpt-4  # Default model to use
TEMPERATURE=0.7  # Default temperature setting
MAX_TOKENS=4000  # Maximum response length
```

⚠️ **Security Note**: 
- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- Keep your API keys secure and rotate them regularly
- Consider using environment variables in production

## Usage

### Basic Input Format

The tool accepts two main inputs:

```python
{
    "content": "", # Content to be researched/analyzed
    "recipe_id": "23634687939724" # Optional recipe ID from database
}
```

### Recipe Structure

When using a recipe ID, the following data structure is retrieved:

```python
{
    "recipe": "Format instructions for the output",
    "examples": "Example outputs showing desired format",
    "ingredients": "List of required information to include",
    "needs_research": "TRUE/FALSE" # Whether additional research is needed
}
```

### Example Output

```python
{
    "overall_assessment": "PASS",
    "score": "9/10",
    "report": {
        "overview": "...",
        "technical_details": "...",
        "benefits": "...",
        "additional_context": "..."
    },
    "quality_metrics": {
        "completeness": "9/10",
        "format_adherence": "10/10",
        "information_quality": "8/10"
    }
}
```

## The Bigger Picture

While this might seem like a focused solution for research tasks, it represents something much more significant. By creating agents that understand their knowledge boundaries - just like humans do - we're taking a step toward more reliable AI systems.

The ability to reason about what they don't know and need to learn could dramatically improve how AI systems:
- Acquire new information
- Validate their knowledge
- Make reliable decisions
- Learn continuously

## Current Limitations

It's important to note that this is v0, and there are known limitations:
- Research quality varies by topic
- Some context nuances may be missed
- Recipe creation requires manual input
- Search capabilities are constrained by available APIs

## Future Directions

Our roadmap for improving the system includes:

### Research Intelligence
- **Adaptive Tool Selection**
  - Dynamic selection of research tools based on content type
  - Integration with GitHub for code research
  - YouTube API for tutorial/demo content
  - Academic paper databases for scholarly research
  - Automatic tool selection based on query type

### Quality Assessment
- **Enhanced Judge Agent Criteria**
  - More sophisticated evaluation metrics
  - Domain-specific assessment criteria
  - Confidence scoring improvements
  - Source credibility weighting

### Model Support

  - Automatic depth determination
  - Resource optimization
  - Context-aware search strategies
  - Priority-based research planning

### Automation
- **Automated Instruction Generation**
  - Self-generating research recipes
  - Dynamic task definition
